### From scratch app built with:

-   react
-   typescript
-   webpack
-   babel
-   jest
-   react-testing-library

### Commands

Run the app locally

-   npm run start

Create a build of the app

-   npm run build

Test

-   npm run test

### Rant

-   I really hate how hard it is to config a javascript application in 2020... just getting this thing to build and run test files was rediculous. Seriously.
